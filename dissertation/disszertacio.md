The relationship between body_mass_g and bill_depth_mm was assessed.A Pearson correlation test showed that scores among the group of body_mass_g and the groupd of bill_depth_mm were negatively correlated, r(df)= -0.472, p=0.0 (CI 95%: [-0.55 -0.38]), N=333 The relationship between body_mass_g and bill_depth_mm was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of body_mass_g and the groupd of bill_depth_mm were negatively correlated, r(df)= -0.429, p=0.0 (CI 95%: [-0.51 -0.34]), N=333 The relationship between body_mass_g and bill_depth_mm was assessed.A Pearson correlation test showed that scores among the group of body_mass_g and the groupd of bill_depth_mm were negatively correlated, r(df)= -0.472, p=0.0 (CI 95%: [-0.55 -0.38]), N=333 The relationship between score and hours was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of score and the groupd of hours were not correlated, r(df)= 0.162, p=0.506 (CI 95%: [-0.32  0.57]), N=19 The relationship between score and prep was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of score and the groupd of prep were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.567, p=0.009 (CI 95%: [0.17 0.81]), N=20 The relationship between score and grade was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of score and the groupd of grade were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.561, p=0.013 (CI 95%: [0.14 0.81]), N=19 The relationship between score and grade was assessed with Skipped spearman correlation.Skipped spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of score and the groupd of grade were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.561, p=0.013 (CI 95%: [0.14 0.81]), N=19 The relationship between score and grade was assessed with Shepherd’s pi correlation (Shepherd’s pi correlation showed that scores among the group of score and the groupd of grade were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.561, p=0.013 (CI 95%: [0.14 0.81]), N=19 The relationship between grade and score was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of grade and the groupd of score were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.561, p=0.013 (CI 95%: [0.14 0.81]), N=19 The relationship between grade and score was assessed with Skipped spearman correlation.Skipped spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of grade and the groupd of score were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.561, p=0.013 (CI 95%: [0.14 0.81]), N=19 The relationship between grade and score was assessed with Shepherd’s pi correlation (Shepherd’s pi correlation showed that scores among the group of grade and the groupd of score were postively correlated, r(df)= 0.561, p=0.013 (CI 95%: [0.14 0.81]), N=19 The relationship between grade and hours was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of grade and the groupd of hours were not correlated, r(df)= 0.452, p=0.052 (CI 95%: [-0.    0.75]), N=19 The relationship between grade and prep was assessed.Spearman correlation test showed that scores among the group of grade and the groupd of prep were not correlated, r(df)= 0.068, p=0.775 (CI 95%: [-0.39  0.5 ]), N=20
