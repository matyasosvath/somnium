            Spearman correlation was computed to assess the linear relationship between A and B.
            A show normal distribution (W=0.97,p=0.892).
            B show normal distribution (W=0.97,p=0.892).
            There was significant positive correlation between the two variables, r(df) = 1.0, p = 0.0.
