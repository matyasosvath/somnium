#Homogenity of Variance, i.e. that the population variances in each group are equal. Test with Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances. 
#In case it is violated, there are two tests that you can run that are applicable when the assumption of homogeneity of variances has been violated: 
#(1) Welch F test or (2) Brown and Forsythe test. Alternatively, you could run a Kruskal-Wallis H test.
